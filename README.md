In this project, I worked on the model of this game. I specifically worked on the Player, GameObject and the Asteroid. The parent class (GameObject) stores all the general information for each object in the game. This includes information about the velocity of the object in relation to the x and y position of the object. Likewise, the body and center of the object is stored in the GameObject. Player and Asteroid update their positions in different ways. The movement of the asteroid is independent of the player and random. On the other hand, the movement of the player is dependent of the keys the player presses. To extend these classes, one feature that needs to be included is to have a 'buffer time' so that when the player spawns on the screen, they do not automatically get hit by the asteroid.
