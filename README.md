## <a name="intro"></a>Game Description

Do you find checkers boring? Do you find chess time-consuming? Then Flipsies is the perfect game for you!

Flipsies is a Python implementation of the famous strategy board game "Othello". With a minimalistic blue-and-black theme, an intuitive interface, and easy installation, Flipsies can be enjoyed by all ages.

Flipsies uses an 8-by-8 board and requires 2 players. Player 1 can only place white stones, and Player 2 can only place black
stones. Initially, the board has two black stones and two white stones arranged in the centre of the board, and gameplay
branches out from the centre. The objective is to have all the stones on the board displaying  your colour by the end of the
game.

The rules of Flipsies are very straightforward. During their turn, each player can place a stone in the same diagonal, column,
or row of another stone of their colour. If any opponent's pieces lie in the middle, they are "flipped": white pieces
become black and black pieces become white. Gameplay ends either when there are no remaining spots on the board to place
stones, or when all the stones on the board display the same colour.
